...
This jungle was once alive with magic.
Light flowed through every leaf.
Fireflies carried dreams.
Creatures walked in gentle glow.
Until the Rune Core was shattered.
Its power scattered.
The jungle fell asleep.
Now... someone has returned.
Not a king.
Not a god.
Just a soul who can listen.
You feel a quiet pulse beneath the soil.
Something is calling you.
Follow the light.
Find what was lost.
Move with the arrow keys.
The forest is waiting.
